<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
    to this years Jellyfin rewind! Just follow the guide to log into your
    server, but dont worry all the communication stays between your server and
    your browser.<br />
    <br />
    If you are paranoid (as you generally should be), feel free to monitor the
    network traffic in the devtools or even checkout the code which is linked
    below!

<div class="warning">
    <h3>But Wait!</h3>
    You will need to have the Playback reporting plugin installed and active!<br
    />
</div>

<div class="info">
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p class="a">
        The Plugin should also be configured to keep at least one year of data,
        else the rewind wont be able to give you a full year recap. You can
        configure this here:
    </p>
    <code> Dashboard > Playback Reporting > Settings > Data Retention </code>
    <p class="b">and set "Keep data for" to at least 1 year</p>
